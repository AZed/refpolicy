  of ipsec.

* Thu Jul 7 2005 Chris PeBenito <selinux@tresys.com> - 20050707
- Changed xml to have modules encapsulated by layer tags, rather
  than putting layer="foo" in the module tags.  Also in the future
  we can put a summary and description for each layer.

- Doc tool now displays templates in the web pages.

  tunables.conf if the files already exist.

  built as a loadable module, included in the monolithic policy,
  or excluded.

	inetd
	kerberos
	nis (ypbind and ypserv)
	ssh (server, client, and agent)
